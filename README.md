# Godot Android Plugin V2

This repository contains two projects that demonstrate how to build and integrate an Android plugin with Godot 4.x:

- `MyGodotPlugin`: This is the Android project that implements the Android plugin. It includes the necessary configurations and code to create a plugin that can be used within the Godot engine.

- `AndroidPluginInterface`: A Godot 4 project that integrates the plugin. It includes examples in both C# and GDScript to show how to interact with the plugin from your game.

The repository additionally provides equivalent GDScript examples.

>Notes
>- Remember to update the `TODO` sections in the code when adapting for your own project.
>- The repo demonstrates minimal setup; you can extend the plugin to access native Android APIs such as sensors, ads, or system services.
